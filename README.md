Wireless is a blender addon

It lets you easily tranform a curve into a cable of predefined shape and 
gives the option to add a tail and / or a head at the extremities.

This way you can quickly create an usb cable, or a rope with knots , or a lead with 
electric sockets.

At the moment you are able to turn on and off wireless on a curve, it loads a default cable type.



How to install it:

Open blender and go to File > User Preferences (Ctrl-Alt-U)

Switch to the Add-ons tab
Choose Install from file and grab the zip file you have downloaded.
Once installed, you have to enable the addon from the add-ons list

Now you in the Tools shelf in the 3D view you have a (new) tab called Misc with the wireless addon pannels are.

Once you have a curve selected, you can use the add-on.
